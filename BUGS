1. The tests for the protocol are there, but could be better organized and
   done in such a way that they require less boilerplate.
2. Add tests for the resolver (mostly to do with error handling and packet
   processing)
3. Add tests for the server (mostly to do with configuration and zones)

PTR records are essential for the functioning of inverse queries, and they
take the form: 1.0.0.10.in-addr.arpa. This change will require:

- Adding PTR record representations
- Adding PTR record serialization and unserialization
- Adding tests for the above
- Making sure that the server correctly resolves PTR queries even though 
  in-addr.arpa should never be considered part of its zone
- Adding PTR records to the server's XML configuration file handling

AAAA records are necessary for IPv6 support, and are defined in RFC
3596 instead of RFC 1035. This change will require:

- Adding AAAA record representations
- Adding AAAA record serialization and unserialization
- Adding tests for the above
- Adding AAAA records to the server's XML configuration file handling

Title: Unimplemented resource records should not get mangled

Type: message

One reason why resolvers using this server might be slow is that they are 
requesting the same information several times, because they don't believe
that the server is actually giving them valid information back, because
the server mangles DNS questions that it doesn't understand.

The following changes need to be made:

- DNSProtocol needs a way of recording the contents of unknown questions, so
  that they can be reconstructed after they are unserialized
- DNSServer needs to use this facility to return client questions unchanged
